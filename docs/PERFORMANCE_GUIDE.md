# âš¡ Performance Optimization Guide

## Performance Features

### 1. GPU Acceleration
All animations use `transform3d` and `backface-visibility: hidden` for GPU acceleration.

### 2. Intersection Observer
Components only animate when visible in the viewport.

### 3. Memory Management
- Cleanup intervals and event listeners
- Efficient particle rendering
- Conditional component rendering

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Real-time FPS, memory, and render time tracking.

### 5. Adaptive Quality
Automatic performance adjustments based on device capabilities.

## Performance Settings

### Animation Speed Control
\`\`\`typescript
// 0.5x = Slower, more detailed animations
// 1x = Normal speed
// 3x = Faster, performance-focused
animationSpeed: 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3
\`\`\`

### Particle Count Management
\`\`\`typescript
// 5 = Minimal particles for low-end devices
// 20 = Balanced for most devices
// 50 = Maximum for high-end devices
particleCount: 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50
\`\`\`

### Performance Modes
- **High Performance**: Maximum FPS, minimal effects
- **Normal**: Balanced performance and visuals
- **Low Performance**: Maximum effects, acceptable FPS

## Optimization Techniques

### CSS Optimizations
- Use `will-change` sparingly and remove after animation
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for animations
- Use `contain` property for layout isolation

### JavaScript Optimizations
- Debounce resize and scroll events
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

### Bundle Optimizations
- Tree-shaking for unused code
- Code splitting for route-based loading
- Lazy loading for heavy components

## Browser Compatibility

### Modern Features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties
- Intersection Observer API
- Performance API

### Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Polyfills for critical features
